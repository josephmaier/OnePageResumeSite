I am a recent graduate from York College of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. During my time in school I accumulated 140 credits and 48 weeks of full-time engineering employment. My courses demonstrate that I had an educational focus on control and power engineering while, also gathering some embedded system experience. I've gained a reputation of being a deep diving, mature, and hard-working individual.

Outside of my career, my hobbies include fly fishing, ultimate frisbee, and camping with my dog. I have continued to take my inherent ability to learn, design, and manage to all my hobbies. For fly fishing, I have studied fish and the creatures they feed on to design and create new lures specific to certain geographic area. For ultimate frisbee, I captained and managed our college's club team for three years. Lastly, for camping, I purchased a cargo van and developed it into a camper van to be able to better enjoy the outdoors with my dog.
